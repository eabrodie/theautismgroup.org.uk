    <h1>Special Interest Groups</h1>

    <p>Many young people on the spectrum have special interests which they would
    like to share with others, but lack the social skills needed to do so. We
    can offer opportunities to help make those connections in a structured and
    understanding environment. </p>

    <p>We cater for young people aged between 11 and 25 who have a diagnosis of
    an autistic spectrum condition and are of mainstream ability, but need
    support to succeed in social situations. They will be able to bring along a
    sibling or friend who shares their interest to help encourage social
    interaction in and out of activity time.</p>

    <p> Our staff and volunteers all have experience of supporting young people
    on the autistic spectrum, are DBS checked and trained in safeguarding. Our
    groups are held at BCA (Berkshire College of Agriculture), Burchetts Green
    and in the Nicholson Centre, Maidenhead. </p>

    <p>For more information on Special Interest Groups contact us on 07454
    375071 or e-mail Ruth at tagthamesvalley@gmail.com </p>
