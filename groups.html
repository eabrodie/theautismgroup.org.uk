    <h1>Special Interest Groups</h1>

    <p> Many young people on the spectrum have special interests which they
    would like to share with others, but lack the social skills needed to do so.
    We can offer opportunities, in activities young people have told us they
    like, to help make those connections in a structured and understanding
    environment. Our staff and volunteers all have experience of supporting
    young people on the autistic spectrum, are DBS checked and trained in
    safeguarding.</p>

    <p>If you are a young person on the autism spectrum you can help us with our
    research into areas of special interest by completing our short,
    confidential <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VQ5WH93'>on-line
    survey here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Our Groups</h2> <p>Our groups cater for young people aged between 11 and
    25 who have a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum condition and are of
    mainstream ability, but need support to succeed in social situations. A
    sibling or friend who shares their interest is welcome to come along too, to
    help encourage social interaction in and out of activity time.</p>

    <h2>Our Groups so far:</h2>

    <h3>Pokémon Magic</h3> <p>A special interest club for players of Pokémon and
    Magic the Gathering Trading Card Games and Pokémon video games on the
    Nintendo DS and Wii U. Sessions cost £5, with the first session free.</p>

    <p>Sat 11th June   2pm to 4.30pm at Berkshire College of Agriculture (BCA)
    Sat 25th June    2pm to 4.30pm  at  Elevate Hub, The Nicholson Centre,
    Maidenhead. If you would like to apply for a place or for more information
    on Special Interest Groups contact Ruth on 07454 375071 or e-mail Ruth at
