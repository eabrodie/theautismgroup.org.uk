We can offer opportunities, in activities young people have told us they like, to help make those connections in a structured and understanding environment. Our staff and volunteers all have experience of supporting young people on the autistic spectrum, are DBS checked and trained in safeguarding.</p>\n<p>If you are a young person on the autism spectrum you can help us with our research into areas of special interest by completing our short, confidential <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VQ5WH93\">on-line survey here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Our Groups</h2>\n<p>Our groups cater for young people aged between 11 and 25 who have a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum condition and are of mainstream ability, but need support to succeed in social situations. A sibling or friend who shares their interest is welcome to come along too, to help encourage social interaction in and out of activity time.</p>\n<h3>Pokémon Magic</h3>\n<p>A special interest club for players of Pokémon and Magic the Gathering Trading Card Games and Pokémon video games on the Nintendo DS and Wii U. Sessions cost £5, with the first session free.</p>\n<p>We meet fortnightly alternating between Berkshire College of Agriculture (BCA), Maidenhead and &nbsp;the Elevate Hub, The Nicholson Centre, Maidenhead on a Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>If you would like to apply for a place or for more information on Special Interest Groups contact Ruth on 07454 375071 or e-mail Ruth at clubs@theautismgroup.org.uk.</p>\n<p>Please note &nbsp;a &nbsp;waiting list is now in operation for this club but look out for news of other special interest clubs starting early in 2017.</p>\n<p>View our flyer <a href=\"/flyer.pdf\">here</a>.</p>",
