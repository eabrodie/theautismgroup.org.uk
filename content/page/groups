We can offer opportunities, in activities young people have told us they like, to help make those connections in a structured and understanding environment. Our staff and volunteers all have experience of supporting young people on the autistic spectrum, are DBS checked and trained in safeguarding. </p><p>If you are a young person on the autism spectrum you can help us with our research into areas of special interest by completing our short, confidential <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VQ5WH93\">on-line survey here</a>. </p><h2>Our Groups</h2><p>Our groups cater for young people aged between 11 and 25 who have a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum condition and are of mainstream ability, but need support to succeed in social situations. A sibling or friend who shares their interest is welcome to come along too, to help encourage social interaction in and out of activity time. </p><h3>Pokémon Magic</h3><p>A special interest club for players of Pokémon and Magic the Gathering Trading Card Games and Pokémon video games on the Nintendo DS and Wii U.
